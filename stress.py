    A more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a variety of instruments that
    have been designed to help measure individual stress levels. The first of these is called the Perceived
    Stress Scale.
    
    The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally
    developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect
    our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts
    during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain
    way. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should
    treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to
    count up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like
    a reasonable estimate.
